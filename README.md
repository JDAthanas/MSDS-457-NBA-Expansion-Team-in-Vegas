# MSDS-457-NBA-Expansion-Team-in-Vegas
We applied analytical models and case studies to predict sponsorship opportunities, customer relationship management, and ticketing and attendance in addition to analyzing player acquisition, salary, and team performance.

Summary

Las Vegas is a prime candidate for an NBA expansion team, with LeBron James expressing interest in owning a team there. The city's growing sports presence includes NFL, NHL, and WNBA teams, and the Vegas Vipers, sharing T-Mobile Arena with the Golden Knights, could capitalize on both local and tourist fan bases. Las Vegas ranks 40th in Nielsen TV market size, but its status as an entertainment hub provides added value.

This report focuses on two crucial components for the Vipersâ€™ success: revenue generation (sponsorships, CRM, ticketing, attendance) and roster acquisition (player performance, salary, costs). Each factor plays a role in NBA team valuations and long-term success. Analysis and modeling were applied to drive front office sports business decision making.
